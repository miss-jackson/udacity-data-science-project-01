# udacity-data-science-project-01
This report was prepared as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Progam. This is my first public data science project. The dataset for this project is fitness analysis provided at kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nithilaa/fitness-analysis). It is a survey covering fitness level, wellbeing and populare activities of 545 people. 

## To run the project you need ...
* Python 3
* Jpyter, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn

## Project Scope
We will answere the following questions in this analysis:
* Are exercises more likely done alone or in a group?
* What are the most popular activities? And when do people exercise?
* If people do not exercise, how will they describe their fitness level? Are rather women describing themselves as unfit?
* Do people exercising at least three times a week have shorter units than people having a lower weekly frequency?
